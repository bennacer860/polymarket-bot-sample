## Strategy: Endgame Sweep (Sweeping the Closing Market)

### Concept
When an event's outcome is essentially decided and the market price rises above **0.95** (approaching 0.99), buy in at that price and wait for official settlement, pocketing the remaining spread as near-certain profit.

### Core Logic
**"Trading time for certainty."** After an event has occurred (e.g., an election result is clear, a sports event has ended) but the market hasn't officially settled, the price hovers close to — but not exactly at — 1.00. Retail investors often can't wait for settlement and sell at 0.997–0.999, leaving arbitrage space.

### Key Data Points
- ~90% of large orders (>$10,000) on Polymarket are executed at prices above 0.95
- Each trade earns ~0.1% profit, but with enough capital and frequency, gains compound significantly

### Risk: Black Swan Events & Whale Manipulation
- **Black swan risk**: Something that seems certain suddenly reverses (e.g., a match result is invalidated, a political scandal overturns an outcome)
- **Whale manipulation loop**:
  1. When price nears 0.99, whales dump large orders pushing price down to ~0.9
  2. They spread FUD in comments and social media to amplify retail panic
  3. After retail panic-sells, whales buy chips at low prices
  4. Once the event settles, whales pocket the 0.9→1.00 spread plus retail's lost profits

### Risk Management
- **Never allocate more than 1/10 of total position to any single market**
- Prioritize markets that are about to settle (within a few hours) and have prices above 0.997
- Shorter time windows mean smaller black swan exposure
-
